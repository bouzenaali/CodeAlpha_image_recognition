# Image Classification (CodeAlpha Internship)
## Description 
This Notebook demonstrates image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This project was completed as part of an internship program at Code Alpha Tech.

## Project Goal:
Build an image recognition system capable of classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 predefined categories.
Utilize TensorFlow and Keras libraries to implement a CNN model for classification.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
